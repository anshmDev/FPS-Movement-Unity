# FPS-Movement-Unity
Simple 3d movement script that I made and am currently working on. 


You can use it but don't forget to credit me.


I will be updating this as much as I can. Currently it has only walking.
I am planning to implement sprinting, crouch, and prone. 

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to post it in the "Issues" and "Pull requests"(Only for changes to code) tab.

 UPDATE: Dead project. Sorry, this script is highly inefficient and does not work when adding weapons and other stuff attached to the player. Sorry for the inconvenience.
