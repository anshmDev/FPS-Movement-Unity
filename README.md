# FPS-Movement-Unity
Simple 3d movement script that I made and am currently working on. 


You can use it but don't forget to credit me.


I will be updating this as much as i can. Currently it has only crouch and walking.
I am planning to implement sprinting, crouch speed change, and prone. 

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to post it in the "Issues" tab.
